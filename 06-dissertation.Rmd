## Doctoral Candidacy

Students who have passed the prelims exam (see Chapter \@ref(comps)) are eligible for promotion to doctoral candidacy and to submit their dissertation proposal.
See the [Dissertation Procedures and Guidelines Manual](https://www.montclair.edu/graduate/wp-content/uploads/sites/58/2018/10/DISSERTATION-PROCEDURES-GUIDELINES-FINAL-10-8-18-2-1.pdf) published by The Graduate School to get you started.

To be recognized as doctoral candidates, students must complete and file [FORM A -Notification of Completion of the Qualifying Assessment and Notification of Admission to Doctoral Candidacy](https://www.montclair.edu/graduate/wp-content/uploads/sites/58/2020/08/Form-A.pdf) with TGS. Students must first sign the form and email it to the DCT for their signature. Students must then return the signed form and all necessary supporting documents (i.e. confirmation of successful completion of the prelim exam, including the final prelim exam documents and grading rubrics ), to [Caren Ferrante](mailto:ferrantec@montclair.edu) and [Rebecca Shiffer-Newton](mailto:shifferr@montclair.edu). Students should copy the DCT on all emails. 
Students are encouraged to submit [FORM B –Approval of the Dissertation Committee](https://www.montclair.edu/graduate/wp-content/uploads/sites/58/2020/08/From-B.pdf) and [FORM C –Request for Approval of Outside Dissertation Committee Member](https://www.montclair.edu/graduate/wp-content/uploads/sites/58/2020/08/Form-C.pdf) at the same time as Form A. Once Forms A, B, and C are submitted and approved, students are eligible to submit [Forms G/H for Dissertation Advisement](https://gradschool.montclair.edu/gradweb/forms/formslogin.php?to=http%3A%2F%2Fgradschool.montclair.edu%2Fgradweb%2Fforms%2Fdissertation.php) and register for dissertation credits. 

## Dissertation

Students’ culminating research experience in the Program is the Dissertation, through which they are expected to make a novel contribution to the field. For the Dissertation, students must collect and analyze primary data, conduct a novel analysis of secondary data, or complete a meta-analysis that fills a significant gap in the literature. Whereas some students might opt to write their Dissertation in the more traditional, expansive format, students are also welcome to produce a more concise document appropriate for submission to a peer-reviewed journal, provided that their faculty mentor approves of this format.  We note here that students writing a journal-ready document are expected to have the same level of expertise in their topic as those writing in the more traditional dissertation format. 

### The Dissertation Committee 

The faculty mentor will serve as Chair of the Dissertation Committee.  The Dissertation Committee must have at least three total members; two must be members of the Psychology Department, and one must be either from another MSU department or from an external institution.  Per TGS policy, the student must complete and file FORM B – Approval of the Dissertation Committee, as well as FORM C – Request for Approval of an Outside Dissertation Committee Member if one or more of their committee members do not hold full-time faculty status at MSU. 

### The Dissertation Proposal 

Once the Dissertation Committee has been approved, the student will complete his or her Dissertation Proposal, which should review the extant literature on the Dissertation topic, assess how the dissertation will represent a novel contribution to the field by fulfilling its specific aims, and outline the methodology, including a description of data sources and statistical analytic techniques. Once the Dissertation Committee Chair has approved the Dissertation Proposal, the student is responsible for distributing the document to all other committee members, who will be given at least two weeks to review it. 

### The Dissertation Proposal Defense 

The student should schedule a mutually convenient two-hour block in which the student and his or her committee will meet for a Dissertation Proposal Defense Meeting. Prior to the meeting, committee members will provide the student with any written feedback on the proposal. During the Dissertation Proposal Defense Meeting, the student will verbally respond to committee members’ feedback, and the student and committee will devise a plan for any revisions and refinements to the proposal. When the student and committee have agreed on this plan, they will complete [FORM D – Approval for Dissertation Proposal](https://www.montclair.edu/graduate/wp-content/uploads/sites/58/2020/08/Form-D.pdf). After the Dissertation Proposal Defense Meeting, the student is responsible for submitting FORM D to TGS for approval. Once TGS approves the proposal, the student must file for IRB approval, if required for the project. Per TGS policy, the faculty mentor may waive the requirement to wait until the proposal is approved to file for IRB approval. 

### Dissertation Format 

Students should prepare their Dissertation in accordance with the guidelines set forth by TGS, with the knowledge that the document will need to be reformatted upon submission to a peer-reviewed journal. Once the Dissertation Committee Chair is satisfied with the student’s Dissertation, the student should distribute the Dissertation to committee members for feedback. Students must address all feedback to the satisfaction of the committee members. The faculty mentor will resolve any disagreements among committee members and ultimately decide when the Dissertation is complete. 

### Dissertation Defense 

Once the Dissertation is complete, the student should work with his or her committee members to identify a mutually convenient date and time for the Dissertation Defense. The student then is required to submit [FORM E – Application for Dissertation Defense Date](https://www.montclair.edu/graduate/wp-content/uploads/sites/58/2020/08/Form-E.pdf) to TGS, accompanied by one hard copy of the dissertation. If the Dean of TGS concurs that the student is ready for the defense, the date is confirmed and the student, Dissertation Committee Chair, or the DCT officially schedules the Dissertation Defense location and time. The Dissertation Committee Chair is required to notify TGS of the location of the defense as soon as it is confirmed. 

Per TGS policy, all members of the Dissertation Committee are required to attend the Dissertation Defense, along with the DCT, an impartial departmental representative, or a representative from TGS (Dean or Associate Dean). The Dissertation Committee Chair is responsible for bringing [Form F – Report of Dissertation Defense](https://www.montclair.edu/graduate/wp-content/uploads/sites/58/2020/08/Form-F.pdf) to the meeting. At the Dissertation Defense, the student should orally present all components of their dissertation and be prepared to answer questions from their Dissertation Committee and others in attendance. 

Three outcomes of the Dissertation Defense, as put forth by the Graduate School are:  

1. pass – no substantive revisions;  
2. pass with conditions – substantive revisions; and  
3. fail – second defense required  

All committee members must sign FORM F, and the faculty mentor must return it to TGS for final approval by the Dean of TGS within 24 hours. 

For further information on formatting guidelines and other MSU procedures for Dissertations, students should refer to the most recent version of The Graduate School’s [Dissertation Procedures and Guidelines Manual](https://www.montclair.edu/graduate/wp-content/uploads/sites/58/2020/09/Dissertation-Procedures-Guidelines-2020-2021-final.pdf) (note that this manual is from 2020-2021).

# Old Comprehensive Exam Process

Cut 1/7/21:

The comprehensive examination process begins in the spring after a student has defended their thesis. The comprehensive exam committee (3+ I/O faculty members) will be constituted by the end of the Spring semester (June) and the exam will begin in the start of the Fall of the student’s third year (September). The general process is as follows:  

+ To begin the comprehensive exam process, students must submit a **2000-2500 word comprehensive exam proposal and reading list** (see Section \@ref(compprop)) by mid-May to early June to the I/O Director. The proposal and reading list outline intended theoretical and empirical scope of students’ dissertation topic. This is **neither a comprehensive review nor a formal dissertation proposal**; rather, it is an introduction to intended PhD area.

+ During the summer, two things occur:
    + The exam committee drafts 3 general I/O question as they pertain to the student’s comprehensive exam proposal. The questions require synthesizing knowledge from core industrial, organizational, and methodological course topics in relation to the student’s dissertation focus (see Section \@ref(compprop)).
    
    + In consultation with their advisor, the student expands the comprehensive exam proposal into a 10-page research proposal showing how they would formulate a hypothetical study to target a specific question. This will include specific aims, significance, innovation or gap addressed, and approach/method. A bibliography of key ideas and seminal works should also be included (not part of page limit).  

+ The comprehensive exam is schedule to take place across two phases beginning in September and typically concluding in October.  
    + Phase one is a single day, open-book written exam. Students are provided the 3 prepared I/O questions and submit written responses along with their 10-page research proposal. The committee has three weeks to evaluate the responses as pass, pass with revision, or fail.
    
    + Upon passage of the written portion (including revisions), the student completes an oral defense before the committee to determine if they demonstrate the necessary knowledge to be permitted into doctoral candidacy.  


## Comprehensive Exam Content and Procedure

Qualifying exams will address basic I/O knowledge and synthetic skills in blending evidence to solving an applied research problem. In a sense, these exams can be considered the literature review and problem development phase which occurs in advance of a formal dissertation proposal. Consequently, it will have two parts: (1) exam proposal and reading list, and (2) written and oral defense. The exam proposal and reading list must be submitted at the beginning of the summer of their second year and comprehension of said list in relation to their degree content will be defended in both written and oral form in the beginning of fall their third year.

### Comprehensive Exam Proposal and Reading List {#compprop}

The **exam proposal** should be a 2000-2500 word outline of the intended dissertation topic which offers a general intellectual rationale, supported by key literature, for exploring scholarship in the chosen area. A good overview addresses theoretical, empirical, and practical concerns in a way which justifies investing time, money, and attention to the topic. We suggest the following outline – akin to the first few paragraphs of a paper – moving from general to specific.  

1. General topic overview (1-4 paragraphs)  
    + What is my research area (State it clearly)
    + Why do I want to study it? (Scholarly rationale)
    + Why is this issue important (Theory, empirical findings, organizational application)
    
2. Introduction to 2-3 questions or areas of inquiry (1-3 paragraphs).
    + State of empirical knowledge related to your topic (substantive)
    + Theoretical, conceptual, or philosophical approaches to studying the topic (frameworks)
    + Methodological approaches used to study topic (tools, designs, variables, etc…)

3. Elaboration on questions/areas of inquiry (1-4 paragraphs per question)
    + Clearly stated question or focus of investigation
    + Bodies of literature, theories, ideas, or arguments to be used to investigate this question
    + Introduction to main themes, methods, or implications expected to explore with this question (preliminary outline)


However formatted, the purpose of the **exam proposal** is to give the committee an outline of the intellectual rationale, supporting key literature (writers, theories, reviews, emerging topics), and scope of the student's intended topic. The proposal provides an articulation of your entry into scholarship within a chosen domain and the kinds of themes or debates you expect to explore. The **proposal** on your primary questions or areas of inquiry should show the following:  

+ Scholarly rationale for question and evidence that is relevant and timely
+ Awareness of key writers, debates, or frameworks
+ Intended scope of question (key versus tangential articles that comprise your focus)
+ Different approaches to answering your questions (e.g., methods or tools)
+ What is expected to be found or gain from this topic (e.g., implication, lessons, results)


Attached to the proposal will be a **reading list** containing an appendix of key references (not included in word limit). The list is informally agreed upon by the student and their committee at the onset of Summer, with the bulk of evaluation falling onto the primary advisory. The generally suggested criteria for assemblage include the following: (1) encompass over 60 original empirical, theoretical, or practical sources, of which at least 5 are major books or reviews (quantitative, qualitative); (2) span 3 or more distinct topics related to the student’s dissertation (e.g., work design, leadership, sociotechnical systems) and draw from their specialization (psychology, data science, business/strategy), (3) include influential or seminal citations along with contemporary or emerging thoughts, (4) encompass a blend of both conceptual content (e.g., constructs, hypotheses, phenomena) and methods (e.g., manipulations, techniques, measures, assessment processes, mixed-methods, analyses), (5) cover both criticisms and supporting evidence, and (6) include at least three different disciplines and/or journals (e.g., management, economics, psychology).

Together, the **exam proposal** and readings list will be used to draft 3 comprehensive exam questions as they pertain to the broader discipline. Once the advisor and committee approve of both the exam proposal and reading list, the student is considered to have passed this phase; inability to provide a list within a timely fashion will result in failure and the student will have a set time framed to provide a full list (considered a ‘retake’).
