## Integrative Literature Review Qualifying Comprehensive Exam

The I/O comprehensive exam is a prospective analysis of the student’s readiness to embark upon their dissertation research. This will take the form of a **publishable** integrative, theoretical, or meta-analytic literature review on the student’s broad area of study. The topic can **expand** the scope of their dissertation and should be comparable to papers published in [*Psychological Bulletin*](https://www.apa.org/pubs/journals/bul), [*Academy of Management Review*](https://journals.aom.org/journal/amr), [*Annual Review of Organizational Psychology and Organizational Behavior*](https://www.annualreviews.org/orgpsych/planned), [*Journal of Management*](https://journals.sagepub.com/home/jom) (biannual review), [*Psychological Review*](https://www.apa.org/pubs/journals/rev), and so forth. A full listing of outlets publishing literature reviews, tutorials on how to write reviews, and examples of reviews are provided below; the student is encouraged to peruse these materials for examples and guidance. The reviewed research topic must bridge multiple theories, concepts, controversies, or findings within a domain of work psychology, systematically organize and review published findings in the area, and identify the key challenges and future directions for the area. Note the quality of the paper must be very high with the exam evaluating the student’s ability to demonstrate:

+ An understanding of main theories, findings, and perspectives in a specialized topic
+ An integration and synthesis of empirical and theoretical knowledge for a chosen topic 
+ A critical analysis of prior research, and
+ Implications for future scholarly and practical work

To be admitted to doctoral candidacy, students must complete both a written and oral exam on their literature review and its connection to past work to ensure familiarity and mastery of relevant theories, empirical findings, reviews, historical trajectories, concepts, measures, techniques, and implications to make a novel and meaningful contribution to the field. Mastery will be defined as understanding, analyzing, and integrating enough general and specialized material literature to cover two entire courses worth of content, which roughly translates into 40+ source materials. The exam will be offered once each year at the start of the Fall semester. This allows the entire summer of their second year for preparation and a make-up opportunity in early winter. Students may take any portion of the exam twice. Two failure attempts will result in dismissal from the program or advanced remediation (see Section \@ref(timeline) for elaboration).

## Scope of Review

The topic should be broad enough that students are able to find enough published papers to support the review. However, it should be focused enough that the paper has depth and students are able to thoughtfully explore the methodological and theoretical issues raised by the topic. The paper should make a contribution; that is, it should not be a simple description of all of the studies that have been conducted on the topic. Instead, it should move the area forward by (a) making a theoretical contribution by, for example, pointing out inconsistencies in the literature and providing suggestions for how future research in this area should resolve them, or providing a theoretical framework to guide future research, or bringing up questions that are important but have yet to be addressed, or (b) making a methodological contribution by, for example, conducting a meta-analysis or other quantitative analysis (e.g., examination of effect sizes) to provide statistical confirmation of an effect.

There is no guideline for number or age of references or studies to review because that will depend on the topic. Very generally, however, papers of this breadth and depth have at least a few dozen references and focus on at least a dozen core papers in the review. The review should focus on peer-reviewed empirical journal articles, but book chapters and other reviews are helpful in guiding a search for references and providing theoretical background. We also suggest that students do not pick a general topic for which there are already many reviews (e.g., what accounts for the sex difference in leadership? What predicts turnover?). Again, we want the paper to make a unique contribution and be publishable.

Here are a few examples of the sort of titles that would meet criteria for a publishable literature review

**1. The efficacy of online coaching for improved leadership behaviors**

This is good because virtual learning is a hot topic yet the review is focused enough (leadership, virtual coaching) so as to not be redundant with general meta-analyses and reviews which have already compared the efficacy of face-to-face and online learning modalities for a range of training outcomes (affective, behavioral, cognitive). At the same time, it is sufficiently broad to cover a variety of literatures which students can knit together into general conclusions (leadership behaviors: transformative, servant, task, planning, conflict, etc.; online coaching: live, adaptive assessment, aps, weekly diaries, dynamic or interactive). Can also delve into different issues, such as whether certain leadership outcomes are more amenable to virtual coaching than others, do effects depend on modality or integration with a broader L&D strategy, and a taxonomy of different ways to coach virtually. 

**2. Distinguishing job satisfaction, organizational commitment, and employee engagement**

This would be a theoretical expansion and review of recent meta-analyses, articles, and other papers attempting to clarify how commonly studied employee attitudes are distinct yet overlapping. It is current, controversial, and one could get into many issues: what is the historical origin of each term and are each conceptually distinct states? What are the advantages & disadvantages of aggregating versus distinguishing attitudes? Among the three which are most powerful for different outcomes (performance, citizenship, turnover) or do they share similar predictive power? How do you recommend using these to take research on attitude and motivational theory forward? This could be a meta-analysis but the challenge would be there are several related meta-analyses so the review would need to expand, augment, or build upon past research in some way. 

**3. Preventing team dissolution: antecedents, processes, and interventions**

In this paper one could review the literature focused primarily on how to prevent a team from falling apart **over time**. The time part is crucial to distinguish from reviews which focus purely on team conflict (disagreement) to a broader consideration of teams disconnecting, disbanding, or even working against one another over time. It also extends beyond conflict to consider other drivers of team dissolution, such as stress, lack of alignment, poor design, and team composition. Finally, the review would be unique in emphasizing any interventions and mechanisms which help teams overcome conflict, stay resilient, maintain cohesion, or hit other processes that help teams stay together. Some of this work is being pursued for teams in extreme environments, such as astronauts on long-term space missions. This could even be a meta-analysis if there are sufficient number of studies looking at an outcome representing team dissolution. One could then provide an integration and analysis of why interventions don’t always work as expected for team dissolution and provide recommendations for moving forward.  

**4. A cross-cultural analysis of career development trajectories**

This could be a broad review bringing together cultural psychology, developmental psychology, and vocational psychology into an integrative focus on how career attitudes, prestige, and aspirations change across the lifespan in different countries. You can ask whether western and eastern countries have different trends in attitudes towards their career over time? Why might that be? What are the cultural/historical/religious reasons that underlie differences in valence and change over time? Is this changing with China’s rapidly westernizing culture? What are the implications of this for international companies, understanding workforce policies, and the generalizability of theories about career development? There are lots of angles one could take with this. 

## Eligibility and Timing

Students are eligible for comprehensive exams when they have met the following requirements:  

1. Completed 36-42 credits worth of core methods, I/O, and elective courses (end of year 2)
2. Completed I/O Research Seminar Readings and Defense (PSYC 691, 692) or I/O MA Thesis (PSYC 698)
3. Selected a formal program mentor for dissertation and research
4. Hold a GPA of 3.00 or higher

## Timeline and Process

The comprehensive examination process begins in the spring after a student has defended their thesis. The I/O Doctoral Director is responsible for assembling an annual exam committee consisting of three or more I/O faculty members. The committee typically includes the Doctoral Director, student’s primary advisor, and one or more independent faculty. The committee will be constituted by the end of the Spring semester (June) and the exam itself will begin in the start of the Fall of the student’s third year (September). The general process is as follows:

1. **Idea Develolpment:** We strongly encourage students to consult with their supervisor for help in picking a comps paper topic, as he or she is the expert in your area. Ideally, this will begin some point during your second year with January being a good starting point to start reviewing ideas and articles. Once students have picked a topic, we also encourage consultation with members of the comprehensive committee to determine whether the topic meets the criteria for a comps paper and for any questions about the paper’s structure prior to drafting the proposal. 

2. **Proposal:** To begin the comprehensive exam process, students must submit a **3-page proposal and example reading list** (see below) by **May 31st** to the I/O PhD Director and exam committee. The proposal and reading list outline intended theoretical and empirical scope of the intended literature review and should include the following sections:
    + **Breadth of Review:** Explain why the area is important for work psychology, why the review is needed, and how the review advances the field. Include:
        + Relevant theories or principles
        + At least two domains, ideas, controversies, methods, or topics to be discussed (e.g., leadership, development, motivation, statistical technique, person v. situation, dynamic criteria, wearable sensors, assessment method, income inequality, etc…)
        + General approach to how review will be conducted (qualitative, quantitative, how comprehensive, boundaries, etc…) 
    + **Review method:** Describe methodology for selecting articles and reviewing findings (see resources and tutorials below)
    + **Example articles:** list several example articles to be reviewed, including any specified by student’s advisor
    
3. **Conduct Review:** During the summer and in consultation with their advisor, the student expands the comprehensive exam proposal into a formal systematic review (see tutorials and suggested readings below, especially Torraco, 2016). The literature review is expected to demonstrate all the following: clear and concise writing, significance, logical or thematic organization, method of review, critical analysis of existing literature, synthesis of findings into new knowledge, exploration of emerging developments or topics, and foundations for future research. While length will vary depending on topic and scope, a typical review/meta-analysis is between 8,000 – 12,000 words. A bibliography of all reviewed works should also be included (not part of page limit).

4. **Review Submission and Evaluation:** The final draft of the review is due **September 1st**. This coincides with SIOP submission deadlines so the student may also submit an abbreviated version of the manuscript to be considered for the annual SIOP conference. In the spirit of journal reviews, the committee has three weeks to evaluate the product as “accepted”, “minor revision”, “major revision” or “rejection” (which amounts to a fail). If “major revision”, then student has 1 month to address comments otherwise the submission is a fail.  

5. **Oral Defense:** Doctoral candidates are expected to be able to communicate effectively and knowledgably both in writing and orally. Within a month of passing the written component (including with revisions), the student completes an oral defense of their literature review. Students are expected to be able to discuss key subject areas or fields of research and to clarify, summarize, or assert different positions or arguments taken in prior written work.
The oral exam itself is to begin with a brief introduction by the PhD Director, with the exam protocol being outlined. The student is expected to present a brief overview of their written portion of the exam. Each member of the committee is given a chance to ask questions, but the format will often shift between relatively structured questioning and a more free-flowing discussion. The discussion will center on the student's literature review but the scope of the exam is not necessarily limited to that material. The examiners will be looking to fill in any perceived gaps in the written work, and to more generally assess the student's facility with the literature and empirical material.
Passage of the oral comprehensive exam signifies the student has appropriate mastery of the field’s central material and is permitted into doctoral candidacy to conduct focused and independent dissertation work.

## Grading

### Literature Review Rubric
        
Grading criteria will be based on both included content and quality of reasoning. Content is based upon the Torraco (2016) checklist for integrative literature reviews which includes evidence of the following: 

+ **Goal:** Is the topic, scope, need, boundaries, and perspective of the review articulated?
+ **Organization:** Is the review organized around logical flows of ideas with a coherent narrative and primary themes? May include diagrams or visual representation.
+ **Methods:** Are the methods for the review sufficiently described, such as how articles identified, included, analyzed, and described? Is the process repeatable?
+ **Critical Analysis:** Identify deficiencies, omissions, conflicts, strengths, and weaknesses of current literature? What is poorly represented or unaddressed?
+ **Synthesis:** Are new ideas, insights, or propositions provided? Might include research agendas, taxonomies, alternative concepts or models, meta-analytic conclusions, or metatheory. 
+ **Future:** Does the review explore future of the topics for the field, such as trends, interdisciplinary developments, or new directions? Is there a foundation for future research or direction on which to build questions?

Quality is reflected in how well the student organizes, integrates, and evaluates previously published material (Bem, 1995). As such, they clearly defined and clarify the problem; summarize previous work in the area; identify relationships, contradictions, gaps, and inconsistencies; and suggested the next step or steps in solving the problem. The cognitive complexity or ‘critical thinking’ exerted in the synthetic function of the review will be evaluated using a simplified variant of Bloom’s Taxonomy of cognitive reasoning to graduate-level writing (Granello, 2001). 

```{r bloom, echo=FALSE, warning=FALSE, message=FALSE}

bloom <- read.csv("bloom.csv", header=TRUE)
kable(bloom, caption = "Application of Bloom’s Taxonomy to Evaluating the Integrated Literature Review")

```

Based upon both the content and quality of the review, each committee member will globally evaluate the review with commentary and render a final decision, just like journal reviewers would. The outcome may be “accepted”, “minor revision”, “major revision”, or “reject”.  If the outcome is “accepted” or “minor revision”, the student proceeds to step 4. If the outcome is major revision, the student must revise the article according to the committee’s comments and achieve an outcome of “accepted” or “minor revision” within a single month; otherwise, the student receives one “fail” and has another month to redress before termination. Finally, if the paper is “reject” the student automatically receives one fail and must reformulate and rewrite substantial portions of their paper and similarly attain an outcome of “accepted” or “minor revision” in order to remain in the doctoral program.  

### Oral Exam Rubric

## Program Dismissal Due to Failed Comprehensive Examination

If a student does not pass their comprehensive examination after all re-attempts have been exhausted, then the following will occur:  

1. The student will be notified in writing that s/he is being dismissed from the PhD program at the end of the current semester due to a failure to pass the comprehensive examination. The student is still eligible to receive an MA degree assuming coursework and capstone have been completed. Notification of dismissal should occur as soon as possible. Either the faculty or the student may request a meeting to discuss the dismissal decision and notification.

2. The student may appeal his/her dismissal to the Dean of the College within five (5) business days of receiving notification of such dismissal.

3. The student may appeal a decision to uphold the dismissal by the Dean of the College to the Dean of the Graduate College and the Office of the Provost within five (5) business days of receiving notification of the Dean of the College’s decision.

4. A decision to uphold the dismissal by the Dean of the Graduate College and the Office of the Provost may be appealed to the President of the University within five (5) business days of receiving notification of the Dean of the Graduate College/Office of the Provost’s decision. The decision of the President is final.

## Resources and Structure for Writing a Systematic Review

Systematic literature reviews occupy an important cornerstone in scientific advancement by summarizing, synthesizing, and critiquing a representative set of literature on a focused topic in an integrated way to produce new frameworks, perspectives, and directions. There are a variety approaches to literature review, including meta-analysis, bibliographic, narrative, critical, or tutorial. Regardless the approach, the purpose of a literature review is to objectively report the current knowledge on a topic and base this summary on previously published research. A useful review serves as a foundation for advancing knowledge, facilitating theory development, closing mature research areas, and uncovering novel research topics.

When crafting a literature review it is important to **summarize** findings into **theoretical implications or propositions** rather than produce a descriptive, annotated bibliography of loosely connected facts. This means you *must impose* some conceptual structure on how the review is conducted which entails several steps. First, there must be a **goal or purpose** to advance understanding of a specific issue. Is this an update of new knowledge for a topic or a temporal review of all findings over several decades? Is the purpose to synthesize, critique, or reconceptualize the topic? Is there a specific question (generalizability, antecedents, time span, growing popularity, convergence of ideas) to be addressed? Is there confusion regarding meaning, value, or application which requires clarification and order? Will the review compare major competing approaches, definitions, and tools? The goal should help establish the *need*, *significance*, or *value* of the review and provide boundaries around what the review attempts to accomplish.

Second, it must be **systematic** in that the review process should be transparent and reproducible. What databases where used? How does it expand pat reviews? What keywords used to identify? Criteria used for study inclusion or exclusion (e.g., language, method, article type)? The student should outline their search strategy for identifying relevant literature in a systematic way so others could replicate the process. Building on the method, students must also choose the right balance between **breadth and depth** when identifying and describing past research. The review should be comprehensive enough to include all relevant studies but also focused enough to highlight important or prototypical studies in detail to promote understanding. It is one thing to say you will review everything about work attitudes and another to specifically review the moderators, mediators, and outcomes of procedural justice in the public sector. The **scope** of the review dictates what will be covered and often depends on the focus and field’s maturity level with long-standing topics requiring that the student synthesize a large body of literature, in comparison to a review on a more novel field where only few studies exist. When very broad, the student can make use of tables and concepts to illustrate findings in an efficient manner.

Three, students should focus on *concepts* rather than *individual studies* in analysis and synthesis. This might include historical development, themes, or methodological variations. Careful identification and evaluation of the underlying ideas, constructs, propositions, or hypotheses linking research promotes deeper understanding of the review’s purpose which then guide the analysis conducted. This is done by extracting relevant results or theories, critically analyzing literature to identify ongoing issues or concepts, and synthesizing findings in a way to identify meaningful cross-study patterns. This can (but need not) lead to a new conceptual framework with propositions. Either way, focusing on concepts instead of studies helps identify controversies and commonalities which builds towards a more coherent and integrative manuscript.  

Finally, a literature review should *derive conclusions and tell the reader where to go*. This reiterates the point a systematic review **must go beyond a descriptive summary of prior literature**. While it is important to describe studies included, it is essential go one step further by evaluating the evidence and recent trends to develop priorities for future research. This is done by deriving meaningful conclusions which answers the questions: What do we learn from this summary and what comes next? This includes carefully evaluating and deriving implications; pointing out gaps, omissions, discrepancies, or conflicts in the literature; and outlining directions for future research. 

Following the steps above provides a coherent review structure which is useful for developing or evaluating a theory, method, or practice. The introduction motivates the topic and describes the contributions of the literature review. The next section describes the systematic review process and the key concepts used. After that, the crucial part is the synthesis and interpretation of the literature review’s findings. This section can but need not lead to the derivation of propositions or a conceptual. The final section of a literature review provides a conclusion and discussion with the boundaries of the review and the future research areas. The order of the sections is not static and can vary depending on the student’s topic. For example, one can also put suggestions for future research directly into the body of the article where the main findings from the literature review are described and/or discussed. However, a coherent structure is an absolute necessity for a systematic literature review.

## Articles, Editorials, and Example Reviews



## OLD STUFF (AS OF 1/7/21)

The comprehensive examination process begins in the spring after a student has defended their thesis. The comprehensive exam committee (3+ I/O faculty members) will be constituted by the end of the Spring semester (June) and the exam will begin in the start of the Fall of the student’s third year (September). The general process is as follows:  

+ To begin the comprehensive exam process, students must submit a **2000-2500 word comprehensive exam proposal and reading list** (see Section \@ref(compprop)) by mid-May to early June to the I/O Director. The proposal and reading list outline intended theoretical and empirical scope of students’ dissertation topic. This is **neither a comprehensive review nor a formal dissertation proposal**; rather, it is an introduction to intended PhD area.

+ During the summer, two things occur:
    + The exam committee drafts 3 general I/O question as they pertain to the student’s comprehensive exam proposal. The questions require synthesizing knowledge from core industrial, organizational, and methodological course topics in relation to the student’s dissertation focus (see Section \@ref(compprop)).
    
    + In consultation with their advisor, the student expands the comprehensive exam proposal into a 10-page research proposal showing how they would formulate a hypothetical study to target a specific question. This will include specific aims, significance, innovation or gap addressed, and approach/method. A bibliography of key ideas and seminal works should also be included (not part of page limit).  

+ The comprehensive exam is schedule to take place across two phases beginning in September and typically concluding in October.  
    + Phase one is a single day, open-book written exam. Students are provided the 3 prepared I/O questions and submit written responses along with their 10-page research proposal. The committee has three weeks to evaluate the responses as pass, pass with revision, or fail.
    
    + Upon passage of the written portion (including revisions), the student completes an oral defense before the committee to determine if they demonstrate the necessary knowledge to be permitted into doctoral candidacy.  


## Comprehensive Exam Content and Procedure

Qualifying exams will address basic I/O knowledge and synthetic skills in blending evidence to solving an applied research problem. In a sense, these exams can be considered the literature review and problem development phase which occurs in advance of a formal dissertation proposal. Consequently, it will have two parts: (1) exam proposal and reading list, and (2) written and oral defense. The exam proposal and reading list must be submitted at the beginning of the summer of their second year and comprehension of said list in relation to their degree content will be defended in both written and oral form in the beginning of fall their third year.

### Comprehensive Exam Proposal and Reading List {#compprop}

The **exam proposal** should be a 2000-2500 word outline of the intended dissertation topic which offers a general intellectual rationale, supported by key literature, for exploring scholarship in the chosen area. A good overview addresses theoretical, empirical, and practical concerns in a way which justifies investing time, money, and attention to the topic. We suggest the following outline – akin to the first few paragraphs of a paper – moving from general to specific.  

1. General topic overview (1-4 paragraphs)  
    + What is my research area (State it clearly)
    + Why do I want to study it? (Scholarly rationale)
    + Why is this issue important (Theory, empirical findings, organizational application)
    
2. Introduction to 2-3 questions or areas of inquiry (1-3 paragraphs).
    + State of empirical knowledge related to your topic (substantive)
    + Theoretical, conceptual, or philosophical approaches to studying the topic (frameworks)
    + Methodological approaches used to study topic (tools, designs, variables, etc…)

3. Elaboration on questions/areas of inquiry (1-4 paragraphs per question)
    + Clearly stated question or focus of investigation
    + Bodies of literature, theories, ideas, or arguments to be used to investigate this question
    + Introduction to main themes, methods, or implications expected to explore with this question (preliminary outline)


However formatted, the purpose of the **exam proposal** is to give the committee an outline of the intellectual rationale, supporting key literature (writers, theories, reviews, emerging topics), and scope of the student's intended topic. The proposal provides an articulation of your entry into scholarship within a chosen domain and the kinds of themes or debates you expect to explore. The **proposal** on your primary questions or areas of inquiry should show the following:  

+ Scholarly rationale for question and evidence that is relevant and timely
+ Awareness of key writers, debates, or frameworks
+ Intended scope of question (key versus tangential articles that comprise your focus)
+ Different approaches to answering your questions (e.g., methods or tools)
+ What is expected to be found or gain from this topic (e.g., implication, lessons, results)


Attached to the proposal will be a **reading list** containing an appendix of key references (not included in word limit). The list is informally agreed upon by the student and their committee at the onset of Summer, with the bulk of evaluation falling onto the primary advisory. The generally suggested criteria for assemblage include the following: (1) encompass over 60 original empirical, theoretical, or practical sources, of which at least 5 are major books or reviews (quantitative, qualitative); (2) span 3 or more distinct topics related to the student’s dissertation (e.g., work design, leadership, sociotechnical systems) and draw from their specialization (psychology, data science, business/strategy), (3) include influential or seminal citations along with contemporary or emerging thoughts, (4) encompass a blend of both conceptual content (e.g., constructs, hypotheses, phenomena) and methods (e.g., manipulations, techniques, measures, assessment processes, mixed-methods, analyses), (5) cover both criticisms and supporting evidence, and (6) include at least three different disciplines and/or journals (e.g., management, economics, psychology).

Together, the **exam proposal** and readings list will be used to draft 3 comprehensive exam questions as they pertain to the broader discipline. Once the advisor and committee approve of both the exam proposal and reading list, the student is considered to have passed this phase; inability to provide a list within a timely fashion will result in failure and the student will have a set time framed to provide a full list (considered a ‘retake’).
