## Integrative Literature Review Qualifying Comprehensive Exam

The I/O comprehensive exam is a prospective analysis of the student’s readiness to embark upon their dissertation research. This will take the form of a **publishable** integrative, theoretical, or meta-analytic literature review on the student’s broad area of study. The topic can **expand** the scope of their dissertation and should be comparable to papers published in [*Psychological Bulletin*](https://www.apa.org/pubs/journals/bul), [*Academy of Management Review*](https://journals.aom.org/journal/amr), [*Annual Review of Organizational Psychology and Organizational Behavior*](https://www.annualreviews.org/orgpsych/planned), [*Journal of Management*](https://journals.sagepub.com/home/jom) (biannual review), [*Psychological Review*](https://www.apa.org/pubs/journals/rev), and so forth. A full listing of outlets publishing literature reviews, tutorials on how to write reviews, and examples of reviews are provided below; the student is encouraged to peruse these materials for examples and guidance. The reviewed research topic must bridge multiple theories, concepts, controversies, or findings within a domain of work psychology, systematically organize and review published findings in the area, and identify the key challenges and future directions for the area. Note the quality of the paper must be very high with the exam evaluating the student’s ability to demonstrate:

+ An understanding of main theories, findings, and perspectives in a specialized topic
+ An integration and synthesis of empirical and theoretical knowledge for a chosen topic 
+ A critical analysis of prior research, and
+ Implications for future scholarly and practical work

To be admitted to doctoral candidacy, students must complete both a written and oral exam on their literature review and its connection to past work to ensure familiarity and mastery of relevant theories, empirical findings, reviews, historical trajectories, concepts, measures, techniques, and implications to make a novel and meaningful contribution to the field. Mastery will be defined as understanding, analyzing, and integrating enough general and specialized material literature to cover two entire courses worth of content, which roughly translates into 40+ source materials. The exam will be offered once each year at the start of the Fall semester. This allows the entire summer of their second year for preparation and a make-up opportunity in early winter. Students may take any portion of the exam twice. Two failure attempts will result in dismissal from the program or advanced remediation (see Section \@ref(timeline) for elaboration).

## Scope of Review

The topic should be broad enough that students are able to find enough published papers to support the review. However, it should be focused enough that the paper has depth and students are able to thoughtfully explore the methodological and theoretical issues raised by the topic. The paper should make a contribution; that is, it should not be a simple description of all of the studies that have been conducted on the topic. Instead, it should move the area forward by (a) making a theoretical contribution by, for example, pointing out inconsistencies in the literature and providing suggestions for how future research in this area should resolve them, or providing a theoretical framework to guide future research, or bringing up questions that are important but have yet to be addressed, or (b) making a methodological contribution by, for example, conducting a meta-analysis or other quantitative analysis (e.g., examination of effect sizes) to provide statistical confirmation of an effect.

There is no guideline for number or age of references or studies to review because that will depend on the topic. Very generally, however, papers of this breadth and depth have at least a few dozen references and focus on at least a dozen core papers in the review. The review should focus on peer-reviewed empirical journal articles, but book chapters and other reviews are helpful in guiding a search for references and providing theoretical background. We also suggest that students do not pick a general topic for which there are already many reviews (e.g., what accounts for the sex difference in leadership? What predicts turnover?). Again, we want the paper to make a unique contribution and be publishable.

Here are a few examples of the sort of titles that would meet criteria for a publishable literature review

**1. The efficacy of online coaching for improved leadership behaviors**

This is good because virtual learning is a hot topic yet the review is focused enough (leadership, virtual coaching) so as to not be redundant with general meta-analyses and reviews which have already compared the efficacy of face-to-face and online learning modalities for a range of training outcomes (affective, behavioral, cognitive). At the same time, it is sufficiently broad to cover a variety of literatures which students can knit together into general conclusions (leadership behaviors: transformative, servant, task, planning, conflict, etc.; online coaching: live, adaptive assessment, aps, weekly diaries, dynamic or interactive). Can also delve into different issues, such as whether certain leadership outcomes are more amenable to virtual coaching than others, do effects depend on modality or integration with a broader L&D strategy, and a taxonomy of different ways to coach virtually. 

**2. Distinguishing job satisfaction, organizational commitment, and employee engagement**

This would be a theoretical expansion and review of recent meta-analyses, articles, and other papers attempting to clarify how commonly studied employee attitudes are distinct yet overlapping. It is current, controversial, and one could get into many issues: what is the historical origin of each term and are each conceptually distinct states? What are the advantages & disadvantages of aggregating versus distinguishing attitudes? Among the three which are most powerful for different outcomes (performance, citizenship, turnover) or do they share similar predictive power? How do you recommend using these to take research on attitude and motivational theory forward? This could be a meta-analysis but the challenge would be there are several related meta-analyses so the review would need to expand, augment, or build upon past research in some way. 

**3. Preventing team dissolution: antecedents, processes, and interventions**

In this paper one could review the literature focused primarily on how to prevent a team from falling apart over time. The time part is crucial to distinguish from reviews which focus purely on team conflict (disagreement) to a broader consideration of teams disconnecting, disbanding, or even working against one another over time. It also extends beyond conflict to consider other drivers of team dissolution, such as stress, lack of alignment, poor design, and team composition. Finally, the review would be unique in emphasizing any interventions and mechanisms which help teams overcome conflict, stay resilient, maintain cohesion, or hit other processes that help teams stay together. Some of this work is being pursued for teams in extreme environments, such as astronauts on long-term space missions. This could even be a meta-analysis if there are sufficient number of studies looking at an outcome representing team dissolution. One could then provide an integration and analysis of why interventions don’t always work as expected for team dissolution and provide recommendations for moving forward.  

**4. A cross-cultural analysis of career development trajectories**

This could be a broad review bringing together cultural psychology, developmental psychology, and vocational psychology into an integrative focus on how career attitudes, prestige, and aspirations change across the lifespan in different countries. You can ask whether western and eastern countries have different trends in attitudes towards their career over time? Why might that be? What are the cultural/historical/religious reasons that underlie differences in valence and change over time? Is this changing with China’s rapidly westernizing culture? What are the implications of this for international companies, understanding workforce policies, and the generalizability of theories about career development? There are lots of angles one could take with this. 

## Eligibility and Timing

Students are eligible for comprehensive exams when they have met the following requirements:  

1. Completed 36-42 credits worth of core methods, I/O, and elective courses (end of year 2)
2. Completed I/O Research Seminar Readings and Defense (PSYC 691, 692) or I/O MA Thesis (PSYC 698)
3. Selected a formal program mentor for dissertation and research
4. Hold a GPA of 3.00 or higher

## Timeline and Process

Each year the I/O Doctoral Director is responsible for assembling the comprehensive exam committee consisting of three or more I/O faculty members. The committee typically includes the Doctoral Director, student’s primary advisor, and at least one independent faculty.  

## General Process and Timelines

The comprehensive examination process begins in the spring after a student has defended their thesis. The comprehensive exam committee (3+ I/O faculty members) will be constituted by the end of the Spring semester (June) and the exam will begin in the start of the Fall of the student’s third year (September). The general process is as follows:  

+ To begin the comprehensive exam process, students must submit a **2000-2500 word comprehensive exam proposal and reading list** (see Section \@ref(compprop)) by mid-May to early June to the I/O Director. The proposal and reading list outline intended theoretical and empirical scope of students’ dissertation topic. This is **neither a comprehensive review nor a formal dissertation proposal**; rather, it is an introduction to intended PhD area.

+ During the summer, two things occur:
    + The exam committee drafts 3 general I/O question as they pertain to the student’s comprehensive exam proposal. The questions require synthesizing knowledge from core industrial, organizational, and methodological course topics in relation to the student’s dissertation focus (see Section \@ref(compprop)).
    
    + In consultation with their advisor, the student expands the comprehensive exam proposal into a 10-page research proposal showing how they would formulate a hypothetical study to target a specific question. This will include specific aims, significance, innovation or gap addressed, and approach/method. A bibliography of key ideas and seminal works should also be included (not part of page limit).  

+ The comprehensive exam is schedule to take place across two phases beginning in September and typically concluding in October.  
    + Phase one is a single day, open-book written exam. Students are provided the 3 prepared I/O questions and submit written responses along with their 10-page research proposal. The committee has three weeks to evaluate the responses as pass, pass with revision, or fail.
    
    + Upon passage of the written portion (including revisions), the student completes an oral defense before the committee to determine if they demonstrate the necessary knowledge to be permitted into doctoral candidacy.

## Comprehensive Exam Content and Procedure

Qualifying exams will address basic I/O knowledge and synthetic skills in blending evidence to solving an applied research problem. In a sense, these exams can be considered the literature review and problem development phase which occurs in advance of a formal dissertation proposal. Consequently, it will have two parts: (1) exam proposal and reading list, and (2) written and oral defense. The exam proposal and reading list must be submitted at the beginning of the summer of their second year and comprehension of said list in relation to their degree content will be defended in both written and oral form in the beginning of fall their third year.

### Comprehensive Exam Proposal and Reading List {#compprop}

The **exam proposal** should be a 2000-2500 word outline of the intended dissertation topic which offers a general intellectual rationale, supported by key literature, for exploring scholarship in the chosen area. A good overview addresses theoretical, empirical, and practical concerns in a way which justifies investing time, money, and attention to the topic. We suggest the following outline – akin to the first few paragraphs of a paper – moving from general to specific.  

1. General topic overview (1-4 paragraphs)  
    + What is my research area (State it clearly)
    + Why do I want to study it? (Scholarly rationale)
    + Why is this issue important (Theory, empirical findings, organizational application)
    
2. Introduction to 2-3 questions or areas of inquiry (1-3 paragraphs).
    + State of empirical knowledge related to your topic (substantive)
    + Theoretical, conceptual, or philosophical approaches to studying the topic (frameworks)
    + Methodological approaches used to study topic (tools, designs, variables, etc…)

3. Elaboration on questions/areas of inquiry (1-4 paragraphs per question)
    + Clearly stated question or focus of investigation
    + Bodies of literature, theories, ideas, or arguments to be used to investigate this question
    + Introduction to main themes, methods, or implications expected to explore with this question (preliminary outline)


However formatted, the purpose of the **exam proposal** is to give the committee an outline of the intellectual rationale, supporting key literature (writers, theories, reviews, emerging topics), and scope of the student's intended topic. The proposal provides an articulation of your entry into scholarship within a chosen domain and the kinds of themes or debates you expect to explore. The **proposal** on your primary questions or areas of inquiry should show the following:  

+ Scholarly rationale for question and evidence that is relevant and timely
+ Awareness of key writers, debates, or frameworks
+ Intended scope of question (key versus tangential articles that comprise your focus)
+ Different approaches to answering your questions (e.g., methods or tools)
+ What is expected to be found or gain from this topic (e.g., implication, lessons, results)


Attached to the proposal will be a **reading list** containing an appendix of key references (not included in word limit). The list is informally agreed upon by the student and their committee at the onset of Summer, with the bulk of evaluation falling onto the primary advisory. The generally suggested criteria for assemblage include the following: (1) encompass over 60 original empirical, theoretical, or practical sources, of which at least 5 are major books or reviews (quantitative, qualitative); (2) span 3 or more distinct topics related to the student’s dissertation (e.g., work design, leadership, sociotechnical systems) and draw from their specialization (psychology, data science, business/strategy), (3) include influential or seminal citations along with contemporary or emerging thoughts, (4) encompass a blend of both conceptual content (e.g., constructs, hypotheses, phenomena) and methods (e.g., manipulations, techniques, measures, assessment processes, mixed-methods, analyses), (5) cover both criticisms and supporting evidence, and (6) include at least three different disciplines and/or journals (e.g., management, economics, psychology).

Together, the **exam proposal** and readings list will be used to draft 3 comprehensive exam questions as they pertain to the broader discipline. Once the advisor and committee approve of both the exam proposal and reading list, the student is considered to have passed this phase; inability to provide a list within a timely fashion will result in failure and the student will have a set time framed to provide a full list (considered a ‘retake’).
